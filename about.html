      Known in Japan as Shingeki no Kyojin, many years ago, the last remnants of
      humanity were forced to retreat behind the towering walls of a fortified
      city to escape the massive, man-eating Titans that roamed the land outside
      their fortress. Only the heroic members of the Scouting Legion dared to
      stray beyond the safety of the walls - but even those brave warriors
      seldom returned alive. Those within the city clung to the illusion of a
      peaceful existence until the day that dream was shattered, and their slim
      chance at survival was reduced to one horrifying choice: kill - or be
      devoured!
